# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

As project administrators and mentors, we are committed to creating an environment where everyone can participate without facing harassment, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, age, education, experience level, nationality, religion, disability, or body size.

We pledge to foster an inclusive, diverse, open, welcoming, and healthy community through our actions and interactions.

## Our Standards

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Use of sexually explicit language or imagery, including unwelcome sexual advances.
- Derogatory comments, personal attacks, or politically motivated statements.
- Sharing others' private information without explicit permission.
- Harassment in public or private contexts.
- Any behavior that could be deemed inappropriate in a professional setting.

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Demonstrating kindness and empathy towards others.
- Using respectful, inclusive language.
- Offering and receiving feedback gracefully.
- Taking responsibility and apologizing for mistakes.
- Prioritizing the well-being of the entire community.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

The project maintainers are responsible for defining and enforcing acceptable behavior standards. They will take fair and appropriate corrective measures in response to any inappropriate behavior.

Project maintainers have the authority to edit, remove, or reject comments, code, issues, pull requests, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They will communicate the reasons for moderation decisions when necessary.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to project administrators, mentors, and all participants across all community spaces.

## Enforcement

Any instances of harassment, abuse, or unacceptable behavior can be reported to project administrators for enforcement by emailing [swapnilskumar99@gmail.com](mailto:yashshuklaxiia@gmail.com). All reports will be promptly and fairly reviewed and investigated.

Project administrators are committed to respecting the privacy of the person reporting the incident.
